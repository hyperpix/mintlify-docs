# Initial Concept
I am building a payfac with billing logic included

# Product Vision
A specialized Payment Facilitator (PayFac) and billing platform designed specifically for AI-first companies. The platform focuses on handling the complexities of modern AI business models, including high-frequency usage events and hybrid pricing structures.

# Target Users
- AI-first companies requiring precise usage-based billing (tokens, compute, seats).
- B2B SaaS platforms needing white-label payments and subscription management.

# Core Goals
- **Flexible Metering:** Support for complex usage-based pricing models such as tokens, compute time, and API requests.
- **Hybrid Billing:** Seamless integration of seat-based and usage-based models.
- **Automated Operations:** Streamlined invoice generation and dunning management for high-volume transactions.

# Key Features
- **Real-time Metering API:** A robust API for high-scale usage event reporting.
- **Billing Logic:** Native support for credits, overages, and seat management.
- **Developer SDKs:** TypeScript SDKs for both server-side integration and client-side checkout flows.
- **Secure Checkout:** Hosted and embedded checkout sessions for secure payment collection.
- **API-First Infrastructure:** Comprehensive API for customer management, billing, and entitlements.
- **Webhook Notifications:** Secure, real-time event delivery system for asynchronous merchant notifications.
