# Product Guidelines

# Visual Identity
- **Aesthetic:** Modern, clean, and developer-centric. Use a professional dark/light mode system with high-contrast typography.
- **Components:** Leverage Radix UI (shadcn) for consistent, accessible, and highly functional interface elements.
- **Animations:** Use Framer Motion and Three.js (as seen in `msandbox-backup`) for subtle, high-quality interactions that feel polished but not distracting.

# Communication Style
- **Tone:** Developer-First. Precise, technical, and objective. Avoid fluff.
- **Voice:** Reliable and authoritative. We speak like a fundamental infrastructure provider.
- **Terminology:** Use standard industry terms for PayFac (onboarding, KYC, sub-merchant) and Billing (metering, dunning, pro-ration).

# User Experience
- **Documentation-First:** Error messages should be helpful and provide actionable steps or links to documentation.
- **Keyboard-Centric:** Support command palettes and keyboard shortcuts for rapid navigation (already using `cmdk`).
- **Transparency:** Clear visualization of complex billing calculations (e.g., showing how usage tokens translated to the final invoice line item).
