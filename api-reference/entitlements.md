Verify if a customer has access to a specific meter or feature toggle.

### Usage-based (Meter)

```bash
curl -X GET "https://api.montra.fi/v1/entitlements?customer_id=cust_123&meter=api-tokens" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <your_api_key>"
```

### Feature-based (Toggle)
Check if a feature toggle is enabled for the customer's current plan.

```bash
curl -X GET "https://api.montra.fi/v1/entitlements?customer_id=cust_123&feature=sso" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <your_api_key>"
```
